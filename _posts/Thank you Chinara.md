This morning I and my classmates met Chinara Satkeeva. She is from Kyrgystan, Bishkek city. We speak in Russian because she know Russian and 
English languages excellently. She is very friendly, smiling and pretty woman. We asked her about something like what is she job and how 
did she start to work. Her story of finding the current job was interesting for me.
