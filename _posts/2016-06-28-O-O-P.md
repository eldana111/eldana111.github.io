Today mainly topic of lessons was OOP (Object-oriented programming). Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. 

My firstly thoughts about this topic were "it will be hard and boring for me" or "I will ask for help again". But it is not hard because firstly miss Sherol (my teacher of game design) got mainly alghortm for programming in OOP. Our exercises were creat programs where several cars drive in diffrent directions and balls which had repelled from walls. 

Today my was Madina. We quikly completed our exercises. I liked to creat program with cars more then alghoritm with balls. Possibly it was easier.
