Today mainly topic of lessons was OOP (Object-oriented programming). Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. 

My firstly thoughts about this topic were "it will be hard and boring for me" or "I will ask for help again". But it is not hard because firstly miss Sherol (my teacher of game design) got mainly alghortm for programming in OOP. Our exercise was creat program where several cars drive in diffrent directions. 

This is mainly alghoritm was posted by miss Sherol:

// Example: Two Car objects
Car myCar1;
Car myCar2; // Two objects!
 
void setup() {
  size(200,200);
  // Parameters go inside the parentheses when the object is constructed.
  myCar1 = new Car(color(255,0,0),0,100,2); 
  myCar2 = new Car(color(0,0,255),0,10,1);
}
 
void draw() {
  background(255);
  myCar1.drive();
  myCar1.display();
  myCar2.drive();
  myCar2.display();
}
 
// Even though there are multiple objects, we still only need one class. 
// No matter how many cookies we make, only one cookie cutter is needed.
class Car { 
  color c;
  float xpos;
  float ypos;
  float xspeed;
 
  // The Constructor is defined with arguments.
  Car(color tempC, float tempXpos, float tempYpos, float tempXspeed) { 
    c = tempC;
    xpos = tempXpos;
    ypos = tempYpos;
    xspeed = tempXspeed;
  }
 
  void display() {
    stroke(0);
    fill(c);
    rectMode(CENTER);
    rect(xpos,ypos,20,10);
  }
 
  void drive() {
    xpos = xpos + xspeed;
    if (xpos > width) {
      xpos = 0;
    }
  }
}
