Recently I played game "but That Was [Yesterday]". from the first minute I was invalved it although it's time of play isn't long.
But time is not a problem actually is good. Because the story of game and time of walkthrough have perfect balance. In this game
i like the story and conditions how to play. Yes, exactly conditions how to play. Because  it was showed during the showingof 
story. 
No strict rules in the game but although the game doesn't present you with definitely instructions, it should be fairly simple to 
figure out what you're supposed to do. From time to time, and from different characters, prompts will appear onscreen to indicate 
you should hit an [arrow] key to perform an action. These actions will carry you through the story to the end.
The story of game is heartwarming, little pathetic and mainly realistic. In the game you follow one person through their emotions 
and memories to learn about the influential people in his life and what they've left him with. There is deep sense about life and 
location of solution of mainly problem this game. 
I repeatedly played the game because developers who created this game penetrated my soul.
