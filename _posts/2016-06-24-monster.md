I think everybody once had his imagine friend. The most people hade he/she in childhood. I had a friend but I had not remembered him
while my family last Saturday did cleaning in the flate. I with my sister cleaned our room. My sister found me old diary wheare I wrote my
secrets and drew something. There is I noticed the one cute monster. I forgot about him. He had amazing appearance. He have length arms 
and legs (possibly he was a basketbollist), two horns and socks. SOCKS! I know in my childhood I have big imagination.
