### Firstly, what is Arduino?

Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light
on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message. Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from 
everyday objects to complex scientific instruments.
